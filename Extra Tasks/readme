We trained classification models like mobilenet/VGGNet16/EfficientNet which are trained only on images and compared their performances. 

These methods will never be accurate if we try to generalize them for the cases where there exist objects of multiple objects in a single image. 
We tried various vision-based methods that can detect the presence of multiple objects using OpenCV libraries and pre-trained object detection networks like YOLOv8, results are shown in the count_no_of_objects.ipynb file. 
All the methods failed to generalize over our dataset as the images are natural and there are a huge number of classes.
We can never get a pre-trained model or train a model that can cover all the objects as everything can be considered as trash at some point in time.
